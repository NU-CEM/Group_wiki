## VASP: The basics

- There are four Vasp input files: POSCAR (atomic positions), POTCAR (atomic potentials), KPOINTS (k-point sampling) and INCAR (calculation settings).
- You also need a submission script (in this case a slurm script) for running on HPC (in this case Oswald).
- An example set of input files can be found in the [vasp demo folder](./VASP_demo)
