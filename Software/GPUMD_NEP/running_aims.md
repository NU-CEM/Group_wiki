- Install FHI-vibes on a local environment on archer2

- Running a single point calculation will need a `relaxation.in` input file which contains input parameters for your DFT -- kgrids, basis sets, convergence parameters. 

- Put the `relaxation.in` and the `geometry.in` file in one folder and submit your [slurm script](./run_fhivibes.slm) to run FHI-vibes!
