Hello and welcome! You've found a good place to start.

## Tools

- Communication is primarily via Slack (NU-CEM workspace)
- Github is used to store code and small datasets (NU-CEM organisation)
  - To use Github effectively you will need to learn about the version control system git. It's a bit of a learning curve, but it's worth it
- Overleaf is for writing collaborative documents using LaTeX
