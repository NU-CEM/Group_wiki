# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Hello and welcome! You've found a good place to start.

## Tools

- Communication is primarily via Slack (NU-CEM workspace)
- Github is used to store code and small datasets (NU-CEM organisation)
  - To use Github effectively you will need to learn about the version control system git. It's a bit of a learning curve, but it's worth it
- Overleaf is for writing collaborative documents using LaTeX
- For more tools please see [this webpage](https://lucydot.github.io/roadmap/)


## Project management

- Project management is over at this repo: https://github.com/NU-CEM/ProjectManagement
- This is a space to record progress. There is an example outline here: https://github.com/NU-CEM/ProjectManagement/weekly-updates/Prakriti/check-in-with-Lucy.md
- If you need inspiration in answering the progress questions take a look at entries from the Whittaker group (e.g. here-https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/blob/master/weekly-updates/Lotty-Coupat/Kirstie-Checkin-Meetings.md)
- You can edit these file directly on github. When you commit it please select ("Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Learn more about pull requests.). I can then merge and add comments before it is published on the main branch. 
- If you get a bit lost with Github do not worry! We can discuss any problems you are having with it. It took me about 2 years to feel comfortable with Git, though I'm sure others will make faster progress :relaxed: 
- *Nb: PhD students will also need to update the e-vision system once a month. This is especially important for Tier-4 visa holders. Note this is a paperwork exercise and should take minimal time to complete - linking to the Github repo rather than re-summarising the meeting is probably easiest*.
